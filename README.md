# Introduction
EduSparks is an education analytics platform, built with react-redux and deployed via firebase. <br/>
EduSparks aims to provide insights for students, instructors and administrators, from data collected in classrooms. <br/>
At present, the data is collected from a submission aggregation platform called Achievement Application developed in National University of Singapore. <br/>
Edusparks delivers 4 key-values: Organisation, Customisation, Real-Time and HightLights. <br/>
How these values are delivered in our applications will be showcased in our user guide and introduction video.
